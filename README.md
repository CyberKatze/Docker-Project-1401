<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ðŸ”° About The Project
In this project you're going to containerize an App with multiple services (at least 2). An example of that can be a back-end service accessing database. It's expected that you make a repository in github or gitlab with all the necessary configs for docker or docker-compose with thorough step-by-step instructions that how we can run, build or stop your App.


<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

## âš¡ What You Should Do
- Define a simple project with (at least 2 services)
- Set up a git repository for it
- Connect it to remote repository (github, gitlab,...)
- Use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) and make `docker-compose.yml` file (recommended way; however, is not the only way)
  - In your `.yml` file, you should define a container for each services
  - Use **Volume**, **Command**, **env variables**, ... if you need them
  - (Optional) You can have two `.yml` files,  one `prod.yml` for production and another `dev.yml` for development
- Write a `README.md` file including step-by-step instructions for running your App
- (Optional) Running services in different machines
- (Optional) Automatic deployment using [github action](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
